# Beacon v2 Production Implementation

Welcome to Beacon v2 Production Implementation (B2PI). This is an application that makes an instance of Beacon v2 be production ready.

## Documentation

Please, go to [B2RI/B2PI docs website](https://b2ri-documentation-demo.ega-archive.org/) to know how to use Beacon v2 Production Implementation.

## Main changes from B2RI

* Handlers of the endpoints are classes, not functions
* Unit testing has been developed for the application, starting with 108 unit tests that cover 4000 lines of code approximately (100%)
* Concurrency testing has been applied for this new beacon instance, showing results of responses for more than 3 million genomic variants splitted in different datasets in less than 100 millisecs, for a total of 1000 requests made by 10 users per second at the same time.
* Linking ids to a dataset in a yaml file is not needed anymore
* A couple more indexes for mongoDB have been applied, that, in addition to the restructuration of the code, have improved the quickness of the responses
* Authentication/Authorization is now applied as a decorator, not as a different container
* LOGS now show more relevant information about the different processes (from request to response) including transaction id, the time of execution of each function and the initial call and the return call
* Exceptions now are raised from the lower layer to the top layer, with information and status for the origin of the exception
* Architecture of the code is not dependent on a particular database, meaning that different types of databases (and more than one) can be potentially applied to this instance (although now only MongoDB is the one developed)
* Parameters are sanitized
* Users can manage what entry types want their beacon to show by editing a manage conf file inside source

### TLS configuration

To enable TLS for the Becaon API set `beacon_server_crt` and `beacon_server_key` to the full paht of the server certificate and server key in `beacon/conf/conf.py` file.

#### TLS secured MongoDB

Edit the file `beacon/connections/mongo/conf.py` and set `database_certificate` to the full path to the client certificate. If a private CA is used also set the `database_cafile` to the full path to the CA certificate.

* The MongoDB client certificate should be in the combined PEM format `client.key + "\n" + client.crt`

For more information and have a testing on TLS, please go to [mongoDB official documentation website](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.1/appendix/security/appendixA-openssl-ca/).

## Prerequisites

You should have installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Data from [RI TOOLS](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools-v2). Please, bear in mind that the datasetId for your records must match the id for the dataset in the /datasets entry type. 

### Light up the database and the Beacon

#### Up the containers

If you are using a build with all the services in the same cluster, you can use:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Note: If you have an Apple Silicon Mac and use [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) as your container runtime, you may have to change the default Colima settings for the Mongo docker container to start correctly.
See [Fredrik MÃ¸rstad](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11494958/fredrik-m%c3%b8rstad)'s answer to [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67498836/docker-chown-changing-ownership-of-data-db-operation-not-permitted) for guidance on how to resolve this issue.

#### Up the containers (with services in independent servers)

If you wish to have each service (or some of them) in different servers, you will need to use the remote version of the docker compose file, and deploy the remote services you need by selecting them individually in the build. Example:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.remote.yml up -d --build beaconprod
```

After that, you will need to configure the IPs in the different conf files to make them connect. Remember to bind the IP in mongo to 0.0.0.0 in case you are making an independent deployment of the beacon and the mongodb.

#### Load the data

To load the database (mongo) just copy your files in the data folder. Then, locate yourself in the mongo folder:

```bash
cd beacon/connections/mongo
```

And execute the next commands (only the ones you need):

```bash
	docker exec mongoprod mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file /data/datasets.json --collection datasets
	docker exec mongoprod mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file /data/individuals.json --collection individuals
	docker exec mongoprod mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file /data/cohorts.json --collection cohorts
	docker exec mongoprod mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file /data/analyses.json --collection analyses
	docker exec mongoprod mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file /data/biosamples.json --collection biosamples
	docker exec mongoprod mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file /data/genomicVariations.json --collection genomicVariations
	docker exec mongoprod mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file /data/runs.json --collection runs
	docker exec mongoprod mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file /data/targets.json --collection targets
	docker exec mongoprod mongoimport --jsonArray --uri "mongodb://root:example@127.0.0.1:27017/beacon?authSource=admin" --file /data/caseLevelData.json --collection caseLevelData
```

This loads the JSON files inside of the `data` folder into the MongoDB database container. Each time you import data you will have to create indexes for the queries to run smoothly. Please, check the next point about how to Create the indexes.

#### Create the indexes

Remember to do this step every time you import new data!!

You can create the necessary indexes running the following Python script:

```bash
docker exec beaconprod python -m beacon.connections.mongo.reindex
```

#### Fetch the ontologies and extract the filtering terms

> This step consists of analyzing all the collections of the Mongo database for first extracting the ontology OBO files and then filling the filtering terms endpoint with the information of the data loaded in the database.

You can automatically fetch the ontologies and extract the filtering terms running the following script:

```bash
docker exec beaconprod python -m beacon.connections.mongo.extract_filtering_terms
```

#### Get descendant and semantic similarity terms

*  If you have the ontologies loaded and the filtering terms extracted* , you can automatically get their descendant and semantic similarity terms by following the next two steps:

1. Add your .obo files inside [ontologies](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-production-prototype/tree/main/beacon/connections/mongo/ontologies) naming them as the ontology prefix in lowercase (e.g. ncit.obo) and rebuild the beacon container with:

2. Run the following script:

```bash
docker exec beaconprod python -m beacon.connections.mongo.get_descendants
```

#### Check the logs

Check the logs until the beacon is ready to be queried:

```bash
docker compose logs -f beaconprod
```

## Usage

You can query the beacon using GET or POST. Below, you can find some examples of usage:

> For simplicity (and readability), we will be using [HTTPie](https://github.com/httpie/httpie).

### Using GET

Querying this endpoit it should return the 13 variants of the beacon (paginated):

```bash
http GET http://localhost:5050/api/g_variants
```

You can also add [request parameters](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2-Models/blob/main/BEACON-V2-Model/genomicVariations/requestParameters.json) to the query, like so:

```bash
http GET http://localhost:5050/api/individuals?filters=NCIT:C16576,NCIT:C42331
```

### Using POST

You can use POST to make the previous query. With a `request.json` file like this one:

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "apiVersion": "2.0"
    },
    "query": {
        "requestParameters": {
    "alternateBases": "G" ,
    "referenceBases": "A" ,
"start": [ 16050074 ],
            "end": [ 16050568 ],
	    "referenceName": "22",
        "assemblyId": "GRCh37"
        },
        "includeResultsetResponses": "HIT",
        "pagination": {
            "skip": 0,
            "limit": 10
        },
        "testMode": false,
        "requestedGranularity": "record"
    }
}

```

You can execute:

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "meta": {
        "apiVersion": "2.0"
    },
    "query": {
        "requestParameters": {
    "alternateBases": "G" ,
    "referenceBases": "A" ,
"start": [ 16050074 ],
            "end": [ 16050568 ],
	    "referenceName": "22",
        "assemblyId": "GRCh37"
        },
        "includeResultsetResponses": "HIT",
        "pagination": {
            "skip": 0,
            "limit": 10
        },
        "testMode": false,
        "requestedGranularity": "record"
    }
}' \
  http://localhost:5050/api/g_variants


```

But you can also use complex filters:

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "apiVersion": "2.0"
    },
    "query": {
        "filters": [
            {
                "id": "UBERON:0000178",
                "scope": "biosample",
                "includeDescendantTerms": false
            }
        ],
        "includeResultsetResponses": "HIT",
        "pagination": {
            "skip": 0,
            "limit": 10
        },
        "testMode": false,
        "requestedGranularity": "count"
    }
}
```

You can execute:

```bash
http POST http://localhost:5050/api/biosamples --json < request.json
```

And it will use the ontology filter to filter the results.

## Allowing authentication/authorization

Go to [auth folder](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-production-prototype/tree/main/beacon/auth/idp_providers) and create an .env file with the next Oauthv2 OIDC Identity Provider Relying Party known information:
```bash
CLIENT_ID='your_idp_client_id'
CLIENT_SECRET='your_idp_client_secret'
USER_INFO='https://login.elixir-czech.org/oidc/userinfo'
INTROSPECTION='https://login.elixir-czech.org/oidc/introspect'
ISSUER='https://login.elixir-czech.org/oidc/'
JWKS_URL='https://login.elixir-czech.org/oidc/jwk'
```

For Keycloak IDP, an "aud" parameter will need to be added to the token's mappers, matching the Audience for the Keycloak realm.

## Dataset configuration

To state if a dataset is test or not or if is synthetic or not, you have to modify the [datasets_conf.yml](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-production-prototype/tree/main/beacon/conf/datasets/datasets_conf.yml), writing the name of the dataset you want to declare and the two possible variables **isTest** and **isSynthetic** with a boolean value.

## Making a dataset public/registered/controlled

In order to assign the security level for a dataset in your beacon, please go to [datasets_permissions.yml](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-production-prototype/tree/main/beacon/permissions/datasets/datasets_permissions.yml) and add your dataset you wish to assign the permissions for it. The 3 possible options to allow for the dataset are public, registered or controlled, which needs to be in the first item under the dataset name. Public means that authentication is not required, registered means authentication required and controlled means authentication required and with specific permissions for the authenticated user. After that, depending on the security level you assigned to the dataset, you can set a **default_entry_types_granularity**, which will set which is the maximum granularity allowed for this dataset, except for the **entry_types_exceptions**, that can assign a particular granularity for a particular entry type. Beware that the entry type needs to match the entry type id you set for each of the entry type files in their respective conf file: id of analysis, individual, etc. 
```
CINECA_synthetic_cohort_EUROPE_UK1:
  public:
    default_entry_types_granularity: record
    entry_types_exceptions:
      - cohort: boolean

random_dataset:
  registered:
    default_entry_types_granularity: count
    entry_types_exceptions:
      - individual: boolean
```
If you have assigned a controlled security level then you can assign a particular granularity per user and per entry type per user. You can do that by creating a **user-list** array with items that belong to each user and that need to have the following structure:
```
AV_Dataset:
  controlled:
    default_entry_types_granularity: record
    entry_types_exceptions:
      - individual: boolean
    user-list:
      - user_e-mail: jane.smith@beacon.ga4gh
        default_entry_types_granularity: count
        entry_types_exceptions:
          - individual: record
``` 

## Managing configuration

### Generic configuration

The beacon needs some configuration in order to show the correct mappings or information. In order to do that, the next variables inside [conf.py](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-production-prototype/tree/main/beacon/conf/conf.py) can be modified for that purpose, being **uri** a critical one for showing the correct domain in the mappings of your beacon. The **uri_subpath** will be added behind this **uri** variable, in case there is an extension of the domain for your beacon.

```bash
beacon_id = 'org.ega-archive.beacon-ri-demo'  # ID of the Beacon
beacon_name = 'Beacon Reference Implementation demo'  # Name of the Beacon service
api_version = 'v2.0.0' # Version of the Beacon implementation
uri = 'http://localhost:5050'
uri_subpath = '/api'
complete_url = uri + uri_subpath
environment = 'test'
description = r"This Beacon is based on synthetic data hosted at the <a href='https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001003338'>EGA</a>. The dataset contains 2504 samples including genetic data based on 1K Genomes data, and 76 individual attributes and phenotypic data derived from UKBiobank."
version = api_version_yaml['api_version']
welcome_url = 'https://beacon.ega-archive.org/'
alternative_url = 'https://beacon.ega-archive.org/api'
create_datetime = '2021-11-29T12:00:00.000000'
update_datetime = ''
default_beacon_granularity = "record" # boolean, count or record
security_levels = ['PUBLIC', 'REGISTERED', 'CONTROLLED']
documentation_url = 'https://b2ri-documentation-demo.ega-archive.org/'
cors_urls = ["http://localhost:3003", "http://localhost:3000"]

# Service Info
ga4gh_service_type_group = 'org.ga4gh'
ga4gh_service_type_artifact = 'beacon'
ga4gh_service_type_version = '1.0'

# Organization info
org_id = 'EGA'  # Id of the organization
org_name = 'European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA)'  # Full name
org_description = 'The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) is a service for permanent archiving and sharing of all types of personally identifiable genetic and phenotypic data resulting from biomedical research projects.'
org_adress = 'C/ Dr. Aiguader, 88, PRBB Building 08003 Barcelona, Spain'
org_welcome_url = 'https://ega-archive.org/'
org_contact_url = 'mailto:beacon.ega@crg.eu'
org_logo_url = 'https://legacy.ega-archive.org/images/logo.png'
org_info = ''
``` 

### Budget configuration

If you wish to put a limit on how many queries can a user or a certain IP make to your beacon, that is now possible. In order to do that, edit the the variables under *Query budget* inside [conf.py](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-production-prototype/tree/main/beacon/conf/conf.py). 

```bash
# Query Budget
query_budget_per_user = False
query_budget_per_ip = False
query_budget_amount = 3
query_budget_time_in_seconds = 20
query_budget_database = 'mongo'
query_budget_db_name = 'beacon'
query_budget_table = 'budget'
```

The variables **query_budget_per_user** and **query_budget_per_ip** are boolean, and if True, they will restrict the queries per user and ip. These depend on **query_budget_amount** which will tell the amount allowed per user/ip and **query_budge_time_in_seconds** which will be the period of time that this amount of queries attempt will last. Bear in mind that activating query budget per user means that if a user is not authenticated, the query will fail unless the query budget per ip is also activated. Both ip and user budgets can be activated at the same time, having preference per user but if unauthenticated, ip queries will also be valid.

### Query rounding

The last thing you can configure inside [conf.py](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-production-prototype/tree/main/beacon/conf/conf.py) is query rounding, editing the variables under that name.

```bash
# Query Rounding
imprecise_count=0 # If imprecise_count is 0, no modification of the count will be applied. If it's different than 0, count will always be this number when count is smaller than this number.
round_to_tens=False #Â If true, the rounding will be done to the immediate superior tenth if the imprecise_count is 0
round_to_hundreds=False #Â If true, the rounding will be done to the immediate superior hundredth if the imprecise_count is 0 and the round_to_tens is false
```

The variable **imprecise_count** will override all the others and will tell beacon to round the counts to a number equal or greater than the one assigned to this variable. After that, the **round_to_tens** is the variable that will have priority if true, and will round a count to the immediate superior tenth. The last one **round_to_hundreds** will do the same as the one before but rounding to the immedate superior hundredth.

### Entry types configuration

Beacon v2 PI API lets you change the configuration of each of the entry types. For doing that, you have to edit the entry types configuration for each entry type (e.g. [analysis.py](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-production-prototype/tree/main/beacon/conf/analysis.py)) and there you will find the next variables:

```bash
endpoint_name="analyses"
open_api_endpoints_definition='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2/main/models/json/beacon-v2-default-model/analyses/endpoints.json'
database='mongo' # The name must match the folder's name in connection that belongs to the desired database.

# Granularity accepted: boolean, count or record
granularity='record'

# Entry type configuration
id='analysis'
name='Bioinformatics analysis'
ontology_id='edam:operation_2945'
ontology_name='Analysis'
specification='Beacon v2.0.0'
description='Apply analytical methods to existing data of a specific type.'
defaultSchema_id='beacon-analysis-v2.0.0'
defaultSchema_name='Default schema for a bioinformatics analysis'
defaultSchema_reference_to_schema_definition='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2/main/models/json/beacon-v2-default-model/analyses/defaultSchema.json'
defaultSchema_schema_version='v2.0.0'
aditionally_supported_schemas=[]
allow_queries_without_filters=True

# Map configuration
singleEntryUrl=True # True if your beacon enables endpoint analyses/{id}
biosample_lookup=True # True if your beacon enables endpoint analyses/{id}/biosamples
cohort_lookup=True # True if your beacon enables endpoint analyses/{id}/cohorts
dataset_lookup=True # True if your beacon enables endpoint analyses/{id}/datasets
genomicVariant_lookup=True # True if your beacon enables endpoint analyses/{id}/g_variants
individual_lookup=True # True if your beacon enables endpoint analyses/{id}/individuals
run_lookup=True # True if your beacon enables endpoint analyses/{id}/runs
```

The most importants are the variable **endpoint_name**, which will change the name of the endpoint that will show the response for analysis type of records, the **granularity**, which will change the maximum granularity allowed for this particular entry type, the **allow_queries_without_filters**, which will allow queries without filters if True to that particular endpoint and the ones that are below *Map configuration* which will activate or deactivate the different endpoints related to this entry type. See explanation next to each of the variables to know more.

### Execute the changes

After editing any comfiguration variable, save the file and restart the API to apply the changes by executing the next command:

```bash
docker compose restart beaconprod
```

## Managing source

You can edit some parameters concerning entry types developed for your Beacon in [manage.py](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-production-prototype/tree/main/beacon/source/manage.py). For that, change to True the entry types you want to have developed and shown with data for your beacon and execute the next command:

```bash
docker compose restart beaconprod
```
